# Koala ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ
A simple programming language packaged with a virtual machine created for learning purposes.  
Try out the demo site [here](https://ndbaker1.github.io/koala/)
## Inspiration
Koala was inspired by languages like `Java` and `C#`, which utilize a virtual machine to facilitate a cross-platform runtime.
The **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**, and **.NET Core** are stack machines, which have many more instructions than register-based machine, but are much simpler to generate code for. 

## Development
Koala is written in `Rust`, making it a great candidate for cross-platform deployment, and also gets the benefit of being able to compile to **WebAssembly** by using `wasm-pack`
